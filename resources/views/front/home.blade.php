                                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Many individuals throughout the country are
                                        suffering from overwhelming debt. Maybe you or your spouse has lost a job or
                                        suffered an injury that resulted in extensive medical bills. Life's
                                        circumstances do
                                        not take into account your financial situation, but you should know that you do
                                        have
                                        options for debt relief. That option is bankruptcy.

                                        There are three main types of bankruptcy cases, and we will help you choose the
                                        option that is best for you and your business or family:

                                        Chapter 7 bankruptcy will clear you of all bills, within certain limits. It also
                                        generally allows you to keep your car and avoid foreclosure as long as you keep
                                        current with the arranged payments.

                                        Chapter 13 bankruptcy is best suited for people who are trying to keep their
                                        house
                                        but have fallen behind on mortgage payments, child support or back taxes. Most
                                        Chapter 13 cases can be filed with a small down payment plus certain costs.

                                        Chapter 11 bankruptcy is intended for businesses seeking to continue operations
                                        while restructuring debts. Bogoraz Law Group, P.C. has extensive experience in
                                        these
                                        cases â€“ experience that can put the business in a stronger position with
                                        creditors.

                                    <p>Emotions and stress can run high during landlord-tenant issues, often resulting
                                        in
                                        legal action. It is understandable that both sides of these disputes have a deep
                                        investment in the rental property. A landlord may rely on the rental income to
                                        repay
                                        a loan, fix issues with the property or use it for other investments. A tenant
                                        has
                                        right of possession of this property as his or her home. Too much interference
                                        by a
                                        landlord may feel like a violation of privacy.

                                        Every commercial or residential landlord will gain serious benefits by working
                                        with
                                        a lawyer. There are also situations where tenants simply need a lawyerâ€™s help.
                                        Our
                                        law firm represents landlords and tenants facing a broad range of legal issues.
                                        Because we represent both parties in various issues, our team offers substantial
                                        insight and perspective into various issues, helping to obtain resolutions as
                                        efficiently and cost-effectively as possible.

                                        SERVICES FOR LANDLORDS

                                        Evictions: We offer a range of services to landlords seeking to repossess their
                                        property. From drafting the required notices to offering in-court
                                        representation, we
                                        know how the process works and how to comply with all of the requirements.

                                        Rental/Lease Contract Review and Advice: A clear, unambiguous and legal rental
                                        contract is the best tool a landlord can have. Not only can it minimize the
                                        conflict
                                        with tenants over unclear lease terms, but it can increase the chances of you
                                        succeeding in an eviction action. We can help ensure that your lease complies
                                        with
                                        New York City and New York State regulations and is clearly written, so that all
                                        parties understand their rights and responsibilities

                                        court representation. We also can write letters to landlords to mediate
                                        agreements
                                        and halt eviction actions and help to keep an eviction off your credit report.

                                        can
                                        pay great dividends for our clients. When litigation is the only means of
                                        resolving
                                        a dispute, our trial experience can make the difference.

                                    <p>Bogoraz Law Group, P.C. delivers a strong defense for our clients against the
                                        full
                                        range of criminal charges. We are not intimidated by government accusations and
                                        will
                                        not let you be either. Whether in court or through negotiation, our experienced
                                        legal team fights to protect your rights in pursuit of the most successful
                                        possible
                                        resolution.

                                        No matter how serious your situation is, our experienced legal team can deliver
                                        an
                                        effective defense that maximizes your chances at a successful result.

                                        Even a first-time DUI conviction in New York can lead to jail time and the loss
                                        of
                                        your driver license. This can make getting to work and handling daily tasks
                                        difficult, if not impossible, so we work very hard on our clientsâ€™ behalf to
                                        defeat
                                        or reduce these charges whenever possible. Defenses can include improper conduct
                                        by
                                        a police officer or a flawed blood test.

                                        Like many states, New York levies a wide range of penalties for drug crimes
                                        based on
                                        the substance and amount involved. If prosecutors allege that the drugs in your
                                        possession exceed the threshold for what the law considers personal use,
                                        potential
                                        sentences can escalate drastically. Our firm represents clients aggressively,
                                        challenging suspect seizures and fighting against overzealous charges.

                                        People accused of rape or other sex crimes face heightened scrutiny and public
                                        shame
                                        that can follow them for the rest of their lives. Even if incorrect or years
                                        old,
                                        your listing in a sexual offender database can destroy your job opportunities
                                        and
                                        even your personal relationships. Accordingly, these charges must be defended
                                        vigorously and skillfully. We have the ability and experience to handle
                                        sensitive
                                        questions relating to consent and relationships in an effective, professional
                                        manner.

                                        Conspiracy charges are sometimes brought when sufficient evidence does not exist
                                        to
                                        prosecute someone for the underlying crime. When authorities try to twist
                                        innocent
                                        conversations or actions into something sinister, our experienced legal team can
                                        help by investigating and presenting the actual nature of what occurred.

                                        White-collar crimes usually involve business and professional people who have
                                        made
                                        poor decisions. Because the evidence of white-collar crimes is often complex
                                        financial documents, it can be difficult determining who is criminally
                                        responsible,
                                        and authorities may accuse an innocent person. These investigations often come
                                        to
                                        light prior to the government even being apprised by the victim. In most cases,
                                        we
                                        can often intercede and prevent the case from being referred to the government
                                        for
                                        criminal prosecution. Many of these cases are filed in federal court and the
                                        stakes
                                        are very high.

                                    <p>Personal injury is a broad area of the law encompassing injuries that are caused
                                        by
                                        the fault or negligence of another person or business. Personal injury lawsuits
                                        can
                                        come in many subcategories, including but not limited to the following:
                                        automobile
                                        accidents, slip/trip and fall accidents, premises or landowner liability,
                                        motorcycle
                                        accidents, wrongful death, product liability, medical malpractice, nursing home
                                        negligence, construction accidents, professional negligence, workplace injuries,
                                        and
                                        etc.


                                        It is important to note that personal injury claims often involve much more than
                                        an
                                        injury lawsuit.


                                        We believe that personal injuries are not just physical cuts and bruises,
                                        sprains/strains, broken bones, neck and back injuries. Personal injury also
                                        includes
                                        PTSD, pain and suffering, emotional and psychological suffering, which always
                                        accompany an accident.


                                        We believe that those who has been genuinely injured as a result of an accident
                                        are
                                        under a lot of stress trying to recover from their injuries and worry about how
                                        the
                                        accident is going to affect their family life, their jobs and, ultimately, their
                                        bank balance. In addition is the stress from the insurance claim adjuster who
                                        may be
                                        trying to push for a quick settlement for a few dollars when you are not
                                        represented
                                        by an experienced attorney. Please remember that the insurance company is not on
                                        your side. It's a business, and it doesn't make money by paying you. It makes
                                        money
                                        by denying and undervaluing claims. We are here to help you obtain compensation
                                        from
                                        those responsible, so that you can focus on healing, rehabilitation, and getting
                                        your feet back on the ground.


                                        Our experienced legal team deals with all aspects of a personal injury claim,
                                        not
                                        just the lawsuit. Your claims will be addressed by an attorney in our office and
                                        your work will never be outsourced to another law firm. If you would like to

                                        to a member of our experienced legal team about how we can assist in protecting
                                        your

                                    <p>When we get married, we expect it to be for a lifetime. When the marriage ends,
                                        we
                                        can end up questioning our self-worth, feeling insecure and being frightened of
                                        the
                                        dynamics in our lives. Deciding to end a marriage is never easy. Unfortunately,
                                        making that choice results in a number of other difficult decisions that must be
                                        made: how to divide marital property, whether to stay in a family home and, if
                                        you
                                        and your spouse have minor children, how parental rights and responsibilities
                                        will
                                        be shared. Because emotions run high, and can exacerbate an already tender
                                        situation, Bogoraz Law Group, P.C., uses a unique approach with our clients.

                                        We help our clients with a wide range of family law matters. Whether you are
                                        initiating a divorce, need to modify or enforce an existing Court Order, draft a
                                        pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreements, or resolve any other family law issue,
                                        we
                                        have the experience and knowledge you need to produce positive results.

                                        Our experienced legal team understands the significance of the decisions you
                                        will
                                        make. We will take the time to explore your options with you, provide a candid
                                        assessment of what you can expect, and develop a strategy that is designed to
                                        achieve your goals. We can help you with the full spectrum of family law issues,
                                        including: uncontested and contested divorce proceedings; child custody and the
                                        development of a parenting plan; establishing child support and spousal support;
                                        dividing marital assets and debts; modifying orders regarding child custody and
                                        visitation; enforcing existing orders helping you collect money due under
                                        existing
                                        support orders.

                                        Emotions run high when dealing with family law legal concerns. It is critical to
                                        enlist the services of a law firm you trust â€” one that is responsive to your
                                        needs

                                        their families.

                                        When you have a lifelong legal partner, you always have someone on hand who can
                                        help
                                        you make informed decisions about what is best for you and your family. We are
                                        hands-on and professional, which means we will collaborate with other
                                        professionals
                                        if you have a highly complex estate.

                                        While the terms and the exact combination may be different, there are a few
                                        estate
                                        planning tools we believe everyone should consider to provide protection both
                                        during
                                        life and after death. These include:

                                        1. Last Will and Testament: This allows you to direct how your assets will be
                                        divided and who will receive your property after death. You can also include
                                        financial terms and guardianship designations for minor children or special
                                        needs
                                        children/adults. You can be creative in setting terms, restrictions or
                                        conditions. A
                                        will must be submitted for probate.


                                        2. Living Trust: This acts as an alternative to a will, providing direction and
                                        protection for your assets during life and after death. One benefit of a living
                                        trust is that it does not require probate, because property is transferred into
                                        the
                                        trust before death.


                                        3. Durable General Power of Attorney: This a very important designation,
                                        granting a
                                        person the legal authority to handle your business and financial affairs in the
                                        event you are unable to do so yourself.


                                        4. Medical Power of Attorney: This is a specific designation for a person you
                                        trust
                                        to make medical decisions about your care in the event you become incapacitated
                                        due
                                        to illness or injury â€” for example, if you are in a serious car accident but
                                        expected to recover.


                                        5. Declaration of Guardian: This document covers situations in which you may be
                                        unable to care for yourself. You designate a person whom you trust to have the
                                        legal
                                        authority to make minor and major decisions about your personal life and quality
                                        of
                                        medical care.


                                        6. Health Care Proxy, Living Will and Do Not Resuscitate Order (DNR): These are
                                        the
                                        documents that allow you to provide guidance for medical professionals and your
                                        guardian about life-sustaining treatment or care for a terminal illness or
                                        injury.

                                        wish to live and work in America for the rest of their lives. Others simply

                                        removal (deportation). This may involve: a waiver of inadmissibility, an

                                        of status, an application for political asylum and/or voluntary departure.

                                        Naturalization and Citizenship

                                        Obtaining citizenship can be a rewarding process. However, it can also be ripe
                                        with
                                        pitfalls for those who are unprepared or unlawfully residing in the country.
                                        When
                                        you visit Bogoraz Law Group, P.C., our naturalization lawyers will help you
                                        determine whether you qualify for citizenship and assist you with your
